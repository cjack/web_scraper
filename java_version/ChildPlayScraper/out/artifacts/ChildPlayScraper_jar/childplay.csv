In Northern Europe it is said that if a ladybird lands on your hand and you blow it away, you will have a wish granted. In Denmark there is a rhyme that asks the ladybird to fly to the sky and ask the Lord for fairer weather in the morning, and it is tradition for children to say the rhyme when they come across a ladybird. In Italy it is considered good luck if a ladybird flies into your bedroom. In central Europe it is said that if a ladybird crawls across a young woman´s hand, she will be married within the year.
